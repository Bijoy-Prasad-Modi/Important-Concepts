//We gonna see concept of synchronus 
//Synchronus means one after another ,As you can see JS execute code top to bottom this called synchronus system
//Where one task starts after another finishes
console.log("i");
console.log("will");
console.log("go to");
console.log("school");
console.log("at morning"); 

//But in Asynchronus system we can do multiple task at a time
